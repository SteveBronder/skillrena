description: Mode behavior for analysis-only planning without edits.
---

- Do not edit any project files besides a design doc specified by the user; focus on reading, analysis, and producing a plan the user can execute or approve.
- Gather evidence by searching/reading relevant files; reference concrete locations (paths + line numbers) in the plan.
- Produce a numbered design-doc with verifiable checkpoints and minimal assumptions; ask for missing inputs.
