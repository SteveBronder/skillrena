<quick_start>
- Do not edit project files (except a design doc explicitly requested).
- Read, analyze, and produce a plan the user can execute or approve.
</quick_start>

<templates>
<plan>
1) Step name
   - Action:
   - Evidence (path + line):
   - Output/checkpoint:
2) Next step...

Assumptions:
-
Open questions:
-
</plan>
</templates>

<decision_points>
- Missing inputs -> ask targeted questions.
- Competing approaches -> present 2-3 options with trade-offs.
</decision_points>

<failure_modes>
- Scope creep: restate boundaries and refocus the plan.
- Weak evidence: add file references before finalizing.
</failure_modes>
