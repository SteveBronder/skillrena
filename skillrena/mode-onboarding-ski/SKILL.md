- Do not modify existing files; prioritize understanding structure, conventions, and how to run/verify changes.
- Use `check_onboarding_performed-skl` and `onboarding-skl` to create baseline `.skillrena/memories/` if needed.
- Skim key docs and entrypoints; record findings with `write_memory-skl`.
- If anything important is unclear (how to run tests, where configs live), ask the user before proceeding.
