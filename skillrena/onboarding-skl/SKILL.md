# Skillrena: onboarding

Goal: write short memories in `.skillrena/memories/`:
- `project_overview.md`
  - A high level overview of the project purpose, goals, and main components.
- `suggested_commands.md`
  - A list of commonly used commands for building, testing, linting, and running the project.
- `style_and_conventions.md`
  - Key coding style guidelines and conventions followed in the project.
- `task_completion_checklist.md`
  - A checklist of steps to verify when completing tasks (e.g. tests, docs, reviews).

Use `rg`/`ls`/`find` to scan docs/config; use `apply_patch` to create files. Keep each memory compact.
