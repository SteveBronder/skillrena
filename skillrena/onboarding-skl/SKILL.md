description: Discover project and create baseline memories.
---

**Behavior**: Read-only discovery. Do not modify project files. Ask if unclear.

**Create these** in `./.{AGENT_NAME}/skills/memories/` via `write_memory-skl`:

- `project_overview.md` - Purpose, goals, main components
- `suggested_commands.md` - Build, test, lint, run commands
- `style_and_conventions.md` - Code style guidelines
- `task_completion_checklist.md` - Verification steps for tasks

Scan docs, configs, and entrypoints. Keep memories compact.
