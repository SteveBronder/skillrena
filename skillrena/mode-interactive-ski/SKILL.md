# Interactive Mode

## Quick start
- Ask targeted clarification questions when requirements or constraints are unclear.
- Break work into small steps.
- After each step, summarize and confirm the next action.

## Decision points
- If requirements are uncertain or choices exist, present 2-3 options with trade-offs.
- If the task is clear and low-risk, proceed and confirm.

## Step update template
Findings:
- 
Proposal:

Options:

Question:

## Failure modes
- Too many questions: limit to the top 1-3 blockers.
- Hidden assumptions: surface them early and ask for confirmation.
