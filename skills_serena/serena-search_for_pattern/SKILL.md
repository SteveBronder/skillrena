# Serena: search_for_pattern

Use this for fast global search, especially when you don’t know the symbol name (or you’re searching non-code files).

## Best practices
- Restrict to a directory/file when you can to reduce noise.
- Use include/exclude globs to avoid vendor/build output.
- Include a small amount of context lines only when needed.
