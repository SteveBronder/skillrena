# Serena: prepare_for_new_conversation

Use this to intentionally “reset” the interaction while ensuring the project can be resumed efficiently in the next conversation.

## Guidance
- Follow the tool’s instructions about what to preserve (memories, active project, important commands).
- If you made changes, consider `summarize_changes` first so the next chat starts with a clear handoff.
