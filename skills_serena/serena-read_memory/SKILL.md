# Serena: read_memory

Use this to retrieve stored project-specific context (e.g., `suggested_commands.md`, style rules, task-completion checklist).

## Tips
- Use `list_memories` first if you don’t know the exact memory name.
- Don’t re-read the same memory repeatedly; cache the important points in your working context.
