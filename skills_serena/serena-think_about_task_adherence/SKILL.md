# Serena: think_about_task_adherence

Use this immediately before edits/refactors to avoid scope creep and to ensure you’re following project conventions.

## Prompts to consider
- Am I solving the user’s actual request (not a different problem)?
- Have I read the relevant style/conventions memories (if present)?
- Is there a smaller, safer change that meets the goal?
