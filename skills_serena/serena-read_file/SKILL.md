# Serena: read_file

Use this to load specific file contents when you need exact text (configs, docs, or small code sections).

## Best practices
- Prefer `get_symbols_overview`/`find_symbol` for code navigation where possible.
- Read the smallest relevant file/section to avoid pulling excessive context.
