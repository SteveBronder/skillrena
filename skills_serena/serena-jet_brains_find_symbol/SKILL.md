# Serena: jet_brains_find_symbol

Use this as an alternative to `find_symbol` when LSP indexing is missing, stale, or not available for the language.

## Tips
- Narrow the search with directory/file restrictions when supported to reduce noise.
- Follow up with `jet_brains_find_referencing_symbols` for impact analysis.
