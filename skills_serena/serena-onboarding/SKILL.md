# Serena: onboarding

Use this when Serena is viewing a project for the first time (or when onboarding memories are missing/outdated).

## Outcome expectations
Onboarding should result in durable memories (via `write_memory`) that capture:
- Project purpose and high-level architecture.
- Tech stack and conventions.
- Commands for build/test/lint/format and running entrypoints.
- What to do when a task is completed (tests, formatting, docs).

## Tips
- Keep file reads focused; prefer directory overviews and key docs (`README`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
