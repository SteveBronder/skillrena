# Serena: insert_before_symbol

Use this when you need to place text before an existing symbol (common for imports, registration, or decorators/attributes).

## Workflow
1. Locate the symbol (`find_symbol` or `get_symbols_overview`).
2. Insert with `insert_before_symbol`.
3. Validate that the insertion ended up above the correct definition.
