# Serena: write_memory

Use this to store durable information that will help future conversations: dev commands, repo structure, style rules, runbooks, and key decisions.

## Best practices
- Prefer a few well-named memories (e.g., `suggested_commands.md`, `style_and_conventions.md`, `task_completion_checklist.md`).
- Keep entries concise and factual; avoid transient details.
- Update existing memories when correcting information rather than creating duplicates.
