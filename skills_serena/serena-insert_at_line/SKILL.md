# Serena: insert_at_line

Use this for surgical insertions when you know the exact line location and symbol tools aren’t sufficient.

## Best practices
- Read context first (`read_file`) to confirm the insertion point.
- Insert the minimum necessary text.
- Re-read after insertion to ensure indentation and formatting are correct.
