# Serena: get_current_config

Use this to confirm which project is active, which tools/modes are available, and what context Serena is operating under.

## When to use
- Right after `activate_project` to verify selection.
- When a tool behaves unexpectedly (wrong repo, missing modes, missing contexts).
