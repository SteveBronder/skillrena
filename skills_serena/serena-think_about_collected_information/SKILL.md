# Serena: think_about_collected_information

Use this after a non-trivial exploration sequence (searches, symbol lookups, file reads) to confirm you have what you need.

## Prompts to consider
- Do I have the exact file/symbol(s) needed to implement the change?
- Did I check for existing patterns/tests before adding new code?
- Is any key information missing that warrants another targeted search?
