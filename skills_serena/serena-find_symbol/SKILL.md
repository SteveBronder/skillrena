# Serena: find_symbol

Use this as your default way to locate functions/classes/methods and their definitions.

## How to use
- Start with an exact name when possible.
- If results are too broad, restrict by `relative_path` (directory or file) and/or symbol kinds.
- Use substring matching only when you’re exploring.

## Follow-ups
- `get_symbols_overview` for a file-level map.
- `find_referencing_symbols` to see where a symbol is used.
